            The climate in Lexington during August can average in the high 80s during the day and low 60s in the evening. The ceremony will be held outside and the reception will be in a temperature controlled space. The wedding attire is dressy casual; we recommend something that will be comfortable in the heat and an extra layer for when it gets cooler in the evening.
            </p>

            We will provide a shuttle service to and from the venue at the two hotels we have arranged blocks through. Sign-up sheets will be available at the front desk for both guests staying at the hotel, as well as those staying elsewhere, but wishing to utilize the service. As the evening winds down, shuttles will run on 30 minute intervals dropping off at each of the two hotels. Guests are also welcome to drive to the venue where valet parking will be provided.

              Because we already share a home together our material needs are fewer. So in addition to a traditional gift registry we have included funds for experiences we can share as a married couple.</p>
              <p>
              Nonetheless, we consider the participation of friends and family in this special day as a uniquely priceless experience and are grateful for the contributions guests can make by celebrating with us.

              We met back in the summer of 2015 at a wedding for Helen’s good friend, Drew’s sister, Emilie. As two people finding ourselves coalescing on countless things, including a mutual disregard for clichés, the irony is admittedly comical. However, the spark ignited not from a bouquet toss but from rich conversation that weekend about our life stories, passion for art, and personal discoveries of love as a discipline of pragmatism. The connection we discovered to one another was compelling and has gone on to reshape our respective worlds.
              </p>
              <p>
              Drew closed a chapter of life as an urban bachelor, Helen opened one for her and her two boys as a blended family. Sometimes letting go of what we’ve known can be challenging. We each can be quite adept at making lemonade out of life’s lemons, even when doing so has prolonged a lack of peak happiness and fulfillment in our lives. But in stepping out of our comfort zones, we’ve found in each other a best friend, an intimate confidant, and a committed advocate of one another’s total potential.
              </p>
              <p>
              Like in jazz, life can be difficult to plan out in advance. Many would argue that trying to do so is to miss the point. We know when we've found the right notes because they feel right and leave us smiling.
